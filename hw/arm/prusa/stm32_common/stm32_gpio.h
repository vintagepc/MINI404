 * GPIO module for STM32 SOCs in QEMU.

 * Adapted for QEMU 5.2 in 2020 by VintagePC <http://github.com/vintagepc>
 * Reworked for more chips in 2022 by VintagePC. Currently the layout is known
 * to be similar for:
 * 	- F030 series,
 *	- G070 series,
 *  - F2xx series (given it originated from the Pebble QEMU project)
 *	- F4xx series (specifically, 407, 427 and 429 are known)
